> We switched from MySQL to H2 to make the project easier for users to run out-of-the-box without needing to configure or connect to an external database, as H2 is an embedded, in-memory database that runs within the application.
> To switch back to MySQL, update the JDBC URL, username, and password in the code, and ensure the MySQL JDBC driver is included in the project dependencies.
